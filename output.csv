This is one platform I loved the most, but of late Airbnb has been responding in such a way that they do not value their host's time or money. I have been following up one payout that had to be released, they now tell me that, I wouldn't be getting the money because they will be adjusting the same for a cancellation penalty (which the guest had cancelled due to lockdown). Can @Airbnb deal with such uncontrollable matter with ease and to help the hosting community as well? #airbnb has been deducting my payout since 2019 for some reservations which was cancelled by guests when the cancellation policy clearly said it's strict. They have been deducting 10000 rupees."

I have rented several times and I had one horrible experience at an AirBnB. Airbnb listened to me, elevated the discussion once they heard everything that happened, tried to help me find a new location confidentially for safety reasons, investigated after I left and they reimbursed me 100%. They treated me much better than the host did. They did everything right when the host did everything wrong. I applaud them for that. Thank you!"

AirBnB has stepped in so many times to assist myself and my potential guests to coordinate the reservations should there be adjustments needed like pricing to fit budget requests. Their 24-7 response has provided me with answers that I have been able to relay to guests... when I can't quite figure it out myself. Their HUGE insurance policy gives both the traveler and me, the host, peace of mind and makes all of us comfortable in an un-expecting world. Their platform is easy to navigate both on my phone and my laptop. But I think the thing that I like the most about AirBnB...are the people I have met who have stayed in my Chicago rental apartment over the years. Travelers traveling."

I ended up being able to download the app, find a good spot, and book the place very quickly. Since then, I've used it a little more in advance. Most recently we used it to book a townhouse in Charleston, SC for a business trip. I've never had any issues with any of the places I've stayed - all were very clean and they've had more room+better amenities than most hotels."

Cheaper than most hotels with more to offer! The more people you have to split costs with the cheaper it is, just make sure to check the maximum occupancy requirements! Many times you can get cheaper rates if you rent from home on the state lines! Many are pet friendly and all have way more room than you would find at any hotel for the same cost! Enjoy the feel of home while away from home!"

Very bias and refused to service, I spent hours jumping through hoops attempting to book and ended up with nothing but wasted time. I was told every excuse form needing to confirm with my bank to system problems. I confirmed all there was to confirm and validate, provided card/banking information and copy of my photo ID. The team was very nonchalant about the issue and put is absolutely no effort in resolving the issue and or accommodate 'me' the customer. There was no one to escalate the problem to like ""Oh well too bad, there is nothing we can do.'' Overall experience is negative. I will say, although their hosts may provide great spaces and excellent service, the Airbnb booking process itself, I can and will not recommend."

The host is texting me asking for money. After two weeks of hell, with Airbnb jerking me around, I had a unexpected loss of hundreds of dollars. This was absolutely devastating. Thanks Airbnb for creating a terrible situation for me. I'm epileptic and broke a lamp while having a grand mal seizure. That's what stress can do for an epileptic. This was after the previous week's Airbnb hosts gave my room away right out from under me. I've never had bad reviews before the that week's situation."

I emailed and spoke with customer service staff -- including one higher-level staff person -- and NONE of them followed up with me, despite each of them assuring me that he or she would."
Rated with 1 star,"Greg of Maricopa, AZ",Verified Reviewer,"Original review: Nov. 18, 2021","If you're thinking about using Airbnb for your next vacation rental, I would advise against it. As a Veteran and senior citizen I feel the host of the rental is more in the business of collecting money than providing a service. We made a reservation for a rental in AZ city (hosts Leon and Michele) and had to cancel two days later. Our credit card was charged the entire amount ($3000) even though we never spent a night there. In our opinion, neither Airbnb nor the hosts can be trusted to treat potential customers fairly. If I could give zero stars I would have."

This is a total ** and waste of money. I clearly gave all the chats and issues but nothing happened. You need to live with it and have wonderful annoying stay wherever you are.
